# Capstone_LACrime

# Project Summary: 
The objective of the project is to analyze and compare how the levels of crime changed within Los Angeles County during the COVID-19 restrictions. The dates examined are January to June from 2019 through 2021. The rate of reported crime, the category of reported crime, and the change from 2019 to 2020 are explored in more depth. The dates were chosen to focus on the first lockdown restrictions placed on California and Los Angeles in March 2020.

# Data Collection Source
The data was collected from the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department. Each year of data is organized into a separate CVS file. Each file was brought into python for cleaning and preliminary analysis.
